# Welcome to my wiki!
Hi! I am Miguel Dorta, student of Computer Engineering at Universidad de La Laguna. I created this wiki because I've found over the years that a lot of guides, tutorials, and explanations of computer-related stuff on the internet is outdated, incomplete, or they don't work at all; therefore, I created this repository of knowledge for myself, my friends, and the general public.

## How to use it?
You, as a guest, can only read the content of the wiki. If you want to explore the content, you can use the search bar on the top of the page, or the directory tree in the left side of the page.

## Did you found an error?
Contact me! I will update the content of this wiki to be error-free and up-to-date as soon as I can.
