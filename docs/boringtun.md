# Install BoringTun with UFW
In this guide I will guide you to install BoringTun (an userspace implementation of WireGuard) in a system with UFW. I will use Debian 11, but it will work with most standard distros.

## 1. Install WireGuard
First we need to install WireGuard. For this we will use the standard package manager of our distro. In my case, I will use APT with the following command:
```bash
apt update
apt upgrade
apt install wireguard
```

## 2. Setup WireGuard
BoringTun uses the same configuration that WireGuard, so we need to setup WireGuard as usual.

### 2.1. Generate keys
If the public and private key were not generated, we need to generate them with the following commands:
```bash
# Generate private key
wg genkey > /etc/wireguard/private.key

# Remove permissions for other users
chmod 0600 /etc/wireguard/private.key

# Generate public key from private key
cat /etc/wireguard/private.key | wg pubkey > /etc/wireguard/public.key
```

### 2.2. Create config file
We need to choose multiple settings for WireGuard. Those are:

- **Range of IPs of our VPN:** I chose **192.168.128.1/24**
- **Server listen port:** I chose the default WireGuard port, **51820**
- **The name of the virtual network interface:** I chose **wg0**
- **Check which physical interface we want to route the traffic to:** I chose **eth0**
- **Whether we want to auto-save the config:** I chose yes (**true**)

With our settings decided, we write the config file in `/etc/wireguard/<interface>.conf` (in my case, `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`) with the following content:

```cfg
[Interface]
Address = 192.168.128.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
SaveConfig = true
PostUp = ufw route allow in on wg0 out on eth0
PostUp = iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PreDown = ufw route delete allow in on wg0 out on eth0
PreDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

### 2.3. Enable forwarding
To enable forwarding, we need to edit the file `/etc/sysctl.conf`, and uncomment or add this line:
```cfg
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
We can check the changes executing:
```bash
sysctl -p
```

### 2.4. Creating and enabling a firewall rule
We need to create and enable a firewall rule to allow inbound connections. The way I find more maintainable is to create an application rule in UFW and enabling it. For this we create a file with path `/etc/ufw/applications.d/boringtun` with the following content:
```cfg
[BoringTun]
title=BoringTun
description=Userspace implementation of WireGuard
ports=51820/udp
```
And we aneble it with the following command:
```bash
ufw allow BoringTun
```

## 3. Setup BoringTun
### 3.1. Install cargo
We will build BoringTun from source, and for that we will need cargo. We do it with the package manager of our distro, in my case:
```bash
apt install cargo
```

### 3.2. Install BoringTun
Then we can install BoringTun, for that we just execute:
```bash
cargo install boringtun
```
This will create an executable in our user's directory (in my case `/root/.cargo/bin/boringtun`). I personally don't like it here, so I will move it to `/opt/bin`, but you can do whatever you prefer, just keep in mind that I'll be using the new path.

### 3.3. Create and enable the systemd service
For that we just need to copy the service of wg-quick. For that we execute:
```bash
cp /lib/systemd/system/wg-quick@.service /lib/systemd/system/boringtun@.service
```

And we modify the content of the new file to add the environment variable that will use BoringTun as the WireGuard implementation, resulting in the file containing the following data:
```systemd
[Unit]
Description=BoringTun for %I
After=network-online.target nss-lookup.target
Wants=network-online.target nss-lookup.target
PartOf=wg-quick.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/usr/bin/wg-quick up %i
ExecStop=/usr/bin/wg-quick down %i
ExecReload=/bin/bash -c 'exec /usr/bin/wg syncconf %i <(exec /usr/bin/wg-quick strip %i)'
Environment=WG_ENDPOINT_RESOLUTION_RETRIES=infinity
Environment=WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=/opt/bin/boringtun    # This is the line we need to add

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Finally, we can start the service with:
```bash
systemctl enable boringtun@wg0.service --now
```
And we can check that it's up and running with:

```bash
systemctl status boringtun@wg0.service
```

## 4. Setup peers
### 4.1. Setup client
I will use the [Official WireGuard App for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android), but the settings will be the same for any client. We need to create a new connection/profile and input our settings like this:

![Screenshot showing setup on Android](./boringtun/android-screenshot.jpg)

The settings means:

- **Interface**
    - **Name:** The name we want to identify the profile with.
    - **Private key:** A generated private key
    - **Public key:** The public key associated with the private key. We will need it for the server.
    - **Addresses:** The range of IPs we want out device to take in the virtual network.
    - **DNS servers:** IP of the DNS servers we want to use in the virtual connection.
- **Peer**
    - **Public key:** The server public key.
    - **Endpoint:** The public address (and port) of our server.
    - **Allowed IPs:** The range of IPs we want to route through the VPN. I chose all of them.

### 4.2. Setup server
We need to set up our peer in the server config. For that we need to shut it down in the first place (since we set SaveConfig=true, and that would overwrite our changes). For that we execute:
```bash
systemctl stop boringtun@wg0.service
```

Then we edit our server config (in my case `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`) and we add an entry per each peer we want to set up. The content of the file will result in something like:
```cfg
[Interface]
Address = 192.168.128.1/24
SaveConfig = true
PostUp = ufw route allow in on wg0 out on eth0
PostUp = iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PreDown = ufw route delete allow in on wg0 out on eth0
PreDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY

# Peer number 1
[Peer]
PublicKey = PEER1_PUBLIC_KEY
AllowedIPs = 192.168.128.2/32

# Peer number 2
[Peer]
PublicKey = PEER2_PUBLIC_KEY
AllowedIPs = 192.168.128.3/32
```

Then we start the service again with the following command:
```bash
systemctl start boringtun@wg0.service
```

And we should be able to connect to the server!
